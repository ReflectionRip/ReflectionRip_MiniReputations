# ReflectionRip_MiniReputations
Miniature Reputation Losses / Gains when attacking all monsters.

This adds a script that changes reputation for killing creatures, similar to that of the named creature reputation system used by water rituals.  When a creature is killed the player will:
* Loose 1 reputation per level of the creature from the factions of the creature.
* Loose 1/2 reputation per level of the creature from the **friend** factions of the creature.
* Gain 1/4 reputation per level of the creature from the **disliked** factions of the creature.
* Gain 1/2 reputation per level of the creature from the **hated** factions of the creature.

The factions and reputations of the creatures are reported when you 'v'iew the creatures.  The reputation gains/losses are silent, otherwise every monster killed would have a pop-up.

## Other Changes

* The Joppa Zealot now has the factions 'Mechanimists' and 'Joppa' and no longer has the faction 'MechaSub'
* Ctesiphus now has the faction 'Cats'
