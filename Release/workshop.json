{"workshopId":1374690302,"Title":"Mini Reputation Changes by Reflection Rip","Description":"Miniature Reputation Losses / Gains when attacking all monsters.\r\n\r\nWhen a creature is killed the player will:\r\n\r\n* Loose 1 reputation per level of the creature from the factions of the creature.\r\n* Loose 1/4 reputation per level of the creature from the friend factions of the creature.\r\n* Gain 1/4 reputation per level of the creature from the hated factions of the creature.\r\n\nThe factions and reputations of the creatures are reported when you 'v'iew the creatures. The reputation gains/losses are silent, otherwise every monster killed would have a pop-up.\r\nThis was created as a way to keep reputations more on par with who the player kills. No more making friends with a faction and then killing all their members. (Well, you can still do that, it is just harder now.) On normal play thoughs this should have little impact on the game play. If a player wants to make friends with a hostile faction (ie/ Snapjaws or Goat Folk) they will have to be more careful and try to avoid killing faction members.\r\nSource can be found on GitHub: https://github.com/ReflectionRip/ReflectionRip_MiniReputations/tree/master/VisualStudio/MiniReputations","Tags":"Reputation","Visibility":"2","ImagePath":"preview.png"}
